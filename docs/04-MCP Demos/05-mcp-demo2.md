# MCP Demo with GitHub Coding Agent

This MCP demo will use the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent. 

The Coding Agent is an autonomous, AI-powered software development agent integrated into GitHub. It can work independently to complete tasks such as fixing bugs, implementing new features, improving test coverage, updating documentation, and addressing technical debt.

## Configuration

First we need to configure MCP servers used by the Coding Agent.

- Navigate to the Repo settings 
- Select `Code and Automation` | `Copilot` | `Coding Agent`.

There is a designated area to enter the MCP servers to be used.  

- Enter the MCP server configuration, as follows:

```json
{ "mcpServers": {
        "colors" : {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://colorsmcp.azure1.dev/",
            "tools": ["*"]
        }
} }
```

Click on  `View Session` to get more detailed view of Copilots activity.

The session log can be lengthy, but if you scroll down, youâ€™ll see where Copilot calls the ColorsMCP server to retrieve the color information.

Once completed, the Pull Request is updated with a summary of the actions taken.  

A reviewer now has an opportunity to inspect what has been done and the has the option to accept the work done by Copilot.

We saw from the Copilot logs, that the color information knowledge was obtained from the ColorsMCP server.
