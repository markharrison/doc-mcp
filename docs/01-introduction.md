## Introduction

This is a transcript of a session where I discussed the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Topics covered include:

- Why is there a need for MCP

- What MCP is, including its architecture and core components

- A demo of MCP — including how to configure it so anyone can run it

- An example of how to develop an MCP server — a potential starter project for connecting to your own knowledge resources
